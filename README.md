# Car Repair Simulation Environment

A MuJoCo/MJX (Brax) based simulation environment for training reinforcement learning agents in automotive repair tasks. This project aims to create a realistic and interactive 3D environment where AI agents can learn to perform various car maintenance and repair procedures.

## Project Overview

This simulation environment provides:
- A detailed 3D model of a car with interactive components
- A robotic arm with interchangeable end effectors
- Various repair and maintenance tasks as reinforcement learning objectives
- Multiple camera perspectives for observation
- Visual feedback for task completion

## Key Components

1. **Car Model**: Detailed 3D model of a car with interactive components (battery, oil system, wheels, etc.)
2. **Robotic System**: A 6-DOF robotic arm with tool changing capabilities
3. **Tooling System**: Various end effectors for different repair tasks
4. **Task System**: Framework for defining and tracking repair objectives
5. **Visualization**: Multiple camera views with visual feedback
